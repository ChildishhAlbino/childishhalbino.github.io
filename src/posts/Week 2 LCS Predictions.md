# _Day One:_

---

### Echo Fox (1-1) v TSM (1-1) -> TSM:

- TSM looked better against tougher opponents than Fox did.
- Fox won't have a carry unless Rush pops off.
- Bot lane difference.

---

### C9 (1-1) v GGS (0-2) -> C9:

- Golden Guardians were a mess in week 1, too many problems to fix in a week.
- Cloud 9 could easily lane kingdom GGS.
- Expect Sneaky to pop off.

---

### 100T (0-2) v Liquid (2-0) -> 100T:

- 100T looked shaky in week 1 but I believe Bang will be the focal point going forward.
- Huhi needs to not be useless against Jensen, Ssumday really needs to be the carry.

---

### FlyQuest (2-0) v CLG (0-2) -> FlyQuest:

- CLG are hot garbage right now.
- POE roughly == Pobelter, Wildturtle > Stixxay.
- Santorin > Wiggly/Moon.

---

### Clutch (2-0) v Optic (1-1) -> Clutch:

- Clutch basically win all 3 of the 5 positions.
- Dardoch and Crown would need to seriously hard carry for Optic to have a chance.
- Clutch are a high variance team however so they could under perform.

# _Day Two:_

---

### GGS v 100T -> 100T

- Both teams under-performed last week, particularly 100T.
- Bang and Aphromoo will perform better.
- Hauntzer v Ssumday will decide early game. I think Ssumday will win that.

---

### Optic v Echo Fox -> Echo Fox

- Echo Fox has a more well rounded bot lane.
- Rush > Dardoch or Meteos.
- Crown would need to hard carry, not sure if he's going to have to resources.

---

### Liquid v Clutch Gaming -> Liquid

- Liquid has much more experience and is a more consistent team.
- Argument could be made that all 5 TL players > all 5 Clutch players. The only counterpoint is that Huni > Impact but I don't think that wins Clutch the game.
- Clutch would need to win middle and bot lane to have a chance.
- Damonte might just hard int against Jensen.

---

### TSM v FlyQuest -> TSM

- Bjergsen should win lane verse Pobelter.
- BrokenBlade was beating Ssumday and Huni in lane. Viper is most definitely not the same class of Top Laner.
- Zmoothie > WildTurtle and JayJ.
- TSM will win as long as they transition to mid-game correctly and are proactive in the early game.

---

### C9 v CLG -> C9

- Licorice is going chomp Darshan or FallenBandit.
- Nisqy and the Bot Lane duo should both win or go even at least as long as they turn their monitors on.
- Svenskeren / Blabber are simply better junglers than Wiggly or Moon right now.
- CLG had way too many problems last week. Weldon could literally be Dumbledore and I doubt he'd know a spell to fix all their problems in a week.
